<p>My current research areas include Bayesian modeling for public health, spatial statistics, and health inequality. </p>

<p>At UTD and UTSW, my dissertation research includes developing methods and open-source software for population health surveillance research, applied research on colorectal cancer prevention in Texas, and exploring the methodological framework of plausible reasoning, as developed by the likes of Harold Jeffreys and George Po&#769;lya.

 </p>

<p> At UBC, my research was focused on the political economy of labor and race. My paper in <i>Florida Historical Quarterly</i> examines the state's convict leasing program (1877-1919), including its rapid exansion in tandem with the lumber industry, the role of physicians in perpetuating the system, and its eventual demise.
