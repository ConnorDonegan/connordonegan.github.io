<p> I am a human geographer studying spatial statistics, research methodology, and social inequalities and health. This site hosts a selection of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writing">writing</a> and statistical <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/software/">software</a> packages I have developed. My research publications span the topics of spatial-statistical theory and methods, public health monitoring (particularly cancer research), urban geography, and an archival study of Florida's convict leasing system. My current work is focused on cancer prevention research and the tighter integration of quantitative methods into realist approaches to social research.

<p> I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas in 2023. I then joined the UT Southwestern Medical Center as a postdoctoral researcher in public health. I studied urban geography and political economy in the geography programs at the University of British Columbia (MA, 2013) and University of Minnesota (BA, 2010). </p>
