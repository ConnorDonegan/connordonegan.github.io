<p> I am a human geographer studying spatial statistics, research methodology, and social and health inequalities. </p>

<p> After completing my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas in 2023, I joined the O'Donnell School of Public Health at UT Southwestern Medical Center as a postdoctoral researcher. I studied urban geography and political economy in the geography programs at University of British Columbia (MA, 2013) and University of Minnesota (BA, 2010). </p>

<p>This site hosts a selection of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writings">writings</a> including archival research on convict leasing in Florida (1877-1919), statistical methods research, and the statistical <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/software/">software</a> packages I have developed.</p>

<p>My dissertation is titled <i>Plausible reasoning and heuristic methodology in human geography: An investigation of colorectal cancer incidence and inequalities in urban Texas, 1999--2019</i>. This work argues for a methodological framework that integrates probability theory with realist philosophies of (social) science, and applies the framework as a guide to the study of cancer incidence and inequalities in Texas. This research will be added to the site as it reaches publication stage.</p>
