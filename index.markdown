<p> I am a human geographer studying social and health inequalities and research methodology. My current work is focused on three areas of concern:

<ul>
  <li> Techniques and software for analyzing spatial data, especially health data </li>
  <li> Methodology and study design techniques for connecting spatial analyses to theoretical models, especially of social and health inequalities </li>
  <li> Case studies on social inequalities and health. </li>
</ul>

This research agenda aims to close the distance between quantitative research that documents the (often extreme) social and health inequalities of our world and more theoretically-guided studies that offer explanatory models.</p>

<p>This site contains selections from my past and current work including archival research on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/florida/">convict leasing</a> in Florida (1877-1919), writing on  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/spatial-stats-theory/">spatial-statistical theory</a>, and the  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/software/">software</a> packages I developed for analyzing health data.</p>

<p> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the O'Donnell School of Public Health, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas in spring of 2023. I studied urban geography and political economy in the geography programs at University of British Columbia (MA, 2013) and University of Minnesota (BA, 2010). </p>

<p>More of my dissertation research will be added as it reaches publication stage. My dissertation is titled <i>Plausible reasoning and heuristic methodology in human geography: An invesitagtion of colorectal cancer incidence and inequalities in urban Texas, 1999--2019</i>, engages with the methodological framework of plausible reasoning (PR) as developed by the likes of George Po&#769;lya and Sir Harold Jeffreys. I am interested in how their writings on PR can contribute to methodology and study design in the social sciences, including for research pertaining to social structures and health.</p>
