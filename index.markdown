<p> I am a human geographer studying social and health inequalities and research methodology. My work is currently focused on three areas:

<ul>
  <li> Techniques and software for analyzing spatial data </li>
  <li> Methodology and study design techniques for connecting spatial analyses to theoretical models </li>
  <li> Case studies on social inequalities and health geography. </li>
</ul>

My current research agenda aims to close the distance between quantitative research that documents inequalities and theoretically-guided studies that offer explanatory models.</p>

<p> After completing my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas in 2023, I joined the O'Donnell School of Public Health at UT Southwestern Medical Center as a postdoctoral researcher. I studied urban geography and political economy in the geography programs at University of British Columbia (MA, 2013) and University of Minnesota (BA, 2010). </p>

<p>This site hosts a selection of my writings including archival research on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/florida/">convict leasing</a> in Florida (1877-1919), a study of  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/spatial-stats-theory/">spatial-statistical theory</a>, and the statistical <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/software/">software</a> packages I have developed.</p>

<p>My dissertation is titled <i>Plausible reasoning and heuristic methodology in human geography: An invesitagtion of colorectal cancer incidence and inequalities in urban Texas, 1999--2019</i>, engages with the epistemological framework of plausible reasoning (PR) as developed by the likes of George Po&#769;lya and Sir Harold Jeffreys. I am interested in how their writings on PR can contribute to methodology and study design in the social sciences, including for research pertaining to social structures and health. More of my dissertation research will be added to the site as it reaches publication stage. </p>
