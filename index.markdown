My dissertation, titled "Plausible reasoning and heuristic methodology in human geography: An invesitagtion of colorectal cancer incidence and inequalities in Texas, 1999--2019", engages with the methodological framework of plausible reasoning, particularly as developed by George Po&#769;lya and Harold Jeffreys. I view plausible reasoning as complementary to realist philosophies of science, and I am interested in its contributions to causal reasoning and its potential to bridge qualitative-quantitative divisions in the social and health sciences. The empirical side of the project is focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in Texas and is concerned with evaluating various explanations of social inequalities in the CRC burden within the context of the state's evolving geographies of class and race.

<p> At UBC, my research was focused on the political economy of labor and race. My paper in <i>Florida Historical Quarterly</i> examines the state's convict leasing program (1877-1919), under which the state prison population was leased to private industry as a bound labor force. The paper discusses its rapid expansion in tandem with the lumber industry, its connection to industrial debt peonage, the role of physicians in managing and defending the system, and its eventual demise. The paper argues that convict leasing expanded (primarily) in connection with industrial-capitalist interests and 'modernizing' forces, rather than those of agricultural capital in the plantation belt.
