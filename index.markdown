<p>My current research areas include Bayesian modeling for public health, spatial statistics, and health inequality. </p>

<p>My dissertation research includes developing methods and open-source software for population health surveillance research, applied research on colorectal cancer prevention in Texas, and exploring the methodological framework of plausible reasoning, as developed by the likes of Harold Jeffreys and George Po&#769;lya.

<p> At UBC, my research was focused on political economies of labor and race. My paper in <i>Florida Historical Quarterly</i> examines the state's convict leasing program (1877-1919), under which the state prison population was leased to private industry as an unpaid labor force. The paper discusses its rapid expansion in tandem with the lumber industry, its connection to debt peonage, the role of physicians in managing and defending the system, and its eventual demise.
