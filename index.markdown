<p> I am a human geographer studying spatial statistics, research methodology, and social and health inequalities. </p>

<p> After completing my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas in 2023, I joined the O'Donnell School of Public Health at UT Southwestern Medical Center as a postdoctoral researcher. I studied urban geography and political economy in the geography programs at University of British Columbia (MA, 2013) and University of Minnesota (BA, 2010). </p>

<p>This site hosts a selection of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writing">writing</a> including archival research on convict leasing in Florida (1877-1919), statistical methods research, and the statistical <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/software/">software</a> packages I have developed.</p>

<p>My dissertation (2023) is titled <i>Plausible reasoning and heuristic methodology in human geography: An investigation of colorectal cancer incidence and inequalities in urban Texas, 1999--2019</i>. This work engages with epistemology and probability within realist theories of (social) science and proposes a methodological framework for the study of health inequalities and social structures. The framework guides my research into cancer incidence and inequalities in Texas, which draws from urban studies and medical sociology's fundamental cause theory. Portions of this work are forthcoming in <i>Annals of the American Association of Geographers</i>; more will be added to the site as publications are finalized. </p>
