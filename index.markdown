<p>I am a geographer with research interests in political economy and health, social-science methodology, and spatial statistics/geographic information science. If you find something of interest on this site, feel free to get in touch with me via e-mail (below).</p>

My dissertation, titled <i>Plausible reasoning and heuristic methodology in human geography: An invesitagtion of colorectal cancer incidence and inequalities in Texas, 1999--2019</i>, engages with the methodological framework of plausible reasoning, particularly as developed by George Po&#769;lya and Harold Jeffreys. I argue that plausible reasoning provides an epistemological complement to critical realist philosophies of science. I am most interested in how these can be combined to support the development of investigative strategies that are appropriate for causal and explanatory research in the social and health sciences, especially where explanations pertain to dynamic social structures. The ideas are developed through an empirical investigation of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston urban regions. The study is concerned with evaluating explanations of social inequalities in the CRC burden within the context of rapid, geographically expansive, and economically polarizing urbanization processes.

<p> A previous research focus of mine was the historical political-economy of labor and race in the US South. My paper "The making of Florida's 'criminal class': race, modernity and the convict leasing program, 1877-1919" (<i>Florida Historical Quarterly</i>) examines Florida's convict leasing program, under which the state prison population was leased to private industry as a bound labor force. The paper examines the rapid expansion of the mostly black and male prison population in tandem with the growth of the lumber industry, its connection to the proliferation of debt peonage and similarly coercive labor arrangements, the role of state physicians in managing and defending the deadly system, and its eventual demise. Among other things, the paper argues that convict leasing expanded (primarily) in connection with industrial-capitalist interests and 'modernizing' forces, rather than those of agricultural capital in the plantation belt.
