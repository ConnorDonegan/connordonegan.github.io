<p>My current research areas include social inequalities in health, spatial statistics, and epistemology. </p>

<p> At UBC, my research was focused on the political economy of labor and race. My paper in <i>Florida Historical Quarterly</i> examines the state's convict leasing program (1877-1919), under which the state prison population was leased to private industry as a bound labor force. The paper discusses its rapid expansion in tandem with the lumber industry, its connection to debt peonage, the role of physicians in managing and defending the system, and its eventual demise.

My dissertation research engages with the methodological framework of plausible reasoning, developed by the likes of Harold Jeffreys and George Po&#769;lya. I am especially interested in the ways that plausible reasoning complements realist philosophies of science and its potential for bridging qualitative-quantitative divisions in the social sciences. The empirical side of the project is focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) in Texas and is concerned with evaluating various explanations of social inequalities in CRC risk within the context of the state's evolving geographies of class and race.
