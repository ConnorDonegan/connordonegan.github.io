I am a GIS specialist and statistical researcher with graduate training in geospatial information sciences (GIS), spatial statistics, and social sciences. My research has appeared in journals of statistics, geography, social history, and public health, and overall strives to bring mathematical and humanistic ways of thinking together. As of April 2025 I will be working as the GIS specialist for the Environment Litigation Group ([ELG](https://www.environmentallitigationgroup.com/)) at Baron and Budd law firm. 

My previous post was as a postdoctoral researcher at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). My work there was focused on statistical methods for modeling spatial and spatial-temporal data, public health applications, and open-source statistical software development. I was also responsible for geospatial analysis and cartographic services in UTSW's Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. In the past I've held statistical consulting, data science, and university teaching (graduate instructor) positions. I have served as a peer-reviewer a variety of journals of statistics, GIS, and health (*Spatial Statistics*, *Statistics in Medicine*, *Nature - Communications Medicine*, *Transactions in GIS*, etc.).

In 2023 I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas. My doctoral dissertation was on epistemology and research methodology with case studies in spatial statistics and health geography/public health. The work builds on the mathematician George Polya's (scandalously neglected) writings on probability theory and plausible reasoning to advocate for a heterodox approach to research methodology. Products of that work have been published in *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, *Geographical Analysis*, and the *Oxford Handbook of the Spatial Humanities* (chapter forthcoming). 

I completed undergraduate and masters degrees in human geography at University of Minnesota and University of British Columbia. There, my attention was focused on political economy, the politics of labor and inequality, and urban geography. I also enjoy playing the guitar, jazz, running, and drawing.
