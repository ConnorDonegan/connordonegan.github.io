I am a geography and geographic information systems (GIS) specialist with over a decade of combined professional experience in university research and teaching, GIS, statistical consulting, and data science roles.

I currently work as the GIS specialist for the Environmental Litigation Group ([ELG](https://www.environmentallitigationgroup.com/)) at Baron & Budd, a leading U.S. plaintiff's law firm. I develop, curate, and manage ELG's environmental data infrastructure and use it to investigate water pollution and corporate polluters across the U.S. 

My education and interests span social science, computing, and statistics and I have published original research in journals of history, statistics, geography, public health, and open-source software. I have also served as a peer reviewer on an invited/ad-hoc basis for a variety of journals (*Statistics in Medicine*, *Nature&mdash;Communications Medicine*, *Spatial Statistics*, *Transactions in GIS*, *International Journal of GIS*, *Scientific Reports*, etc.).

I am a big fan of jazz and the guitar, labor unions, reading widely, open-source software, and outdoor excercise (mostly running and biking).
