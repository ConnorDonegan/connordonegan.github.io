I am a statistical researcher with training in spatial statistics, geographic information science (GIS), human geography, and public health. This site hosts my blog, selections from my published writings, and my statistical software. Over the past decade, I've published writings on a range of topics, including labor history, contemporary politics, statistical methods, and public health monitoring. 

I'm now a postdoctoral researcher in public health at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center where I'm studying (a) recent changes in the Texas colorectal cancer burden and (b) statistical methods for modeling spatial and spatial-temporal health data. I also provide geospatial analysis and cartography support for the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.

I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas in 2023, where I studied spatial statistics, Bayesian modeling, and social science methodology. I wrote my doctoral dissertation on epistemology and research methodology, building especially on the mathematician George Polya's (scandalously neglected) writings on probable inference. Products of that work have been published in *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, *Geographical Analysis*, and the *Oxford Handbook* series (chapter forthcoming). In the past I've held statistical consulting, data science, and university teaching (graduate instructor) positions.

I completed undergraduate and masters degrees in human geography at University of Minnesota and University of British Columbia. There, my attention was focused on political economy, the politics of labor and inequality, and urban geography. I also enjoy the guitar, running, and drawing.
