I am a geography and geographic information systems (GIS) specialist with over a decade of combined professional experience in university research and teaching, statistical consulting, data science, and GIS roles.

I currently work as the GIS specialist for the Environmental Litigation Group ([ELG](https://www.environmentallitigationgroup.com/)) at Baron & Budd, a leading U.S. plaintiff's law firm. I develop, curate, and manage ELG's environmental data infrastructure and use it to investigate water pollution and corporate polluters across the U.S. 

I completed a PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences at UT Dallas and continued adacemic research as a postdoc at UT Southwestern Medical Center. My research interests span the social sciences, computing, and statistics and I have published my writing in journals of history, statistics, geography, and public health. I've also served as a peer reviewer on an ad-hoc/invited basis for a number of journals in geography/GIS, statistics, and public health (*Spatial Statistics*, *Transactions in GIS*, *Statistics in Medicine*, *Nature&mdash;Communications Medicine*, etc.).

I am a big fan of jazz and the guitar, labor unions, reading widely, open-source software, and outdoor excercise (mostly running and biking).
