I am a GIS professional and statistical researcher with training in geographic information science (GIS), spatial statistics, human geography, and public health. This site hosts my blog, selections from my published writings, and my statistical software. Over the past decade, I've published writings on a range of topics, including spatial statistics and research methodology, public health, and social history.

I'm now a postdoctoral researcher in public health at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center where I'm studying recent changes in the Texas colorectal cancer burden, statistical methods for modeling spatial and spatial-temporal health data, and spatial accessibility to preventive health services in Texas. I also provide geospatial analysis and cartographic support for the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. In the past I've held statistical consulting, data science, and university teaching (graduate instructor) positions.

In 2023 I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at UT Dallas. My doctoral dissertation is on epistemology and research methodology with case studies in spatial statistics and public health. Products of that work have been published in *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, *Geographical Analysis*, and the *Oxford Handbook* series (chapter forthcoming). The work builds on the mathematician George Polya's (scandalously neglected) writings on probability and plausible reasoning to advocate for a heterodox approach to quantitative research methodology.

I completed undergraduate and masters degrees in human geography at University of Minnesota and University of British Columbia. There, my attention was focused on political economy, the politics of labor, and urban geography. I also enjoy playing the guitar, running, and drawing.
