I am a geographer and statistical researcher with graduate training in spatial statistics, social science, and geospatial information sciences (GIS). I currently work as the GIS Specialist for the Environment Litigation Group ([ELG](https://www.environmentallitigationgroup.com/)) at Baron and Budd law firm, where I research water pollution and industrial polluters. I've published my work in journals of statistics, geography, history, and public health. Outside of work I enjoy playing the guitar, jazz, politics, and running.

I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at the University of Texas at Dallas in 2023. My dissertation was on methodology, with case studies in spatial statistics and public health. Products of that work have been published in *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, *Geographical Analysis*, and the *Oxford Handbook of the Spatial Humanities* (chapter forthcoming).

From 2023 to 2025 I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). I worked on statistical methods for spatial and spatial-temporal data, public health applications, and developing open-source statistical software for health research. I was also responsible for geospatial analysis and cartographic services in UTSW's Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. I have served as a peer-reviewer for various journals of statistics, GIS, and health, including *Statistics in Medicine*, *Spatial Statistics*, *Transactions in GIS*, *IJGIS*, *Scientific Reports*, and *Nature&mdash;Communications Medicine*. I've previously held statistical consulting, data science, and university teaching (graduate instructor) positions.

I completed an undergraduate in human geography at University of Minnesota&mdash;Twin Cities and a masters degrees in human geography at University of British Columbia&mdash;Vancouver. There, my attention was focused on the political economy of globalization and neoliberalism, labor, and inequality.
