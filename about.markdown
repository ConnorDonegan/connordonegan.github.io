I am a  geography, statistics and geospatial information science (GIS) professional currently working as the geospatial information specialist for the Environment Litigation Group ([ELG](https://www.environmentallitigationgroup.com/)) at Baron and Budd law firm. I design, manage, and leverage ELG's data infrastructure for researching water pollution and polluters. I completed graduate training in social science, GIS, and spatial statistics and have published my research in peer-reviewed journals of geography, history, statistics, software, and public health. Outside of work I enjoy playing the guitar, jazz, politics, and running.

In 2023 I completed my PhD in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at the University of Texas at Dallas. My dissertation was about methodology and probability theory, with case studies in spatial statistics and health geography. Products of that work have been published in *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, *Geographical Analysis*, *Oxford Handbook of the Spatial Humanities* (chapter forthcoming), and as open-source statistical software packages.

From 2023 to 2025 I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). I worked on statistical methods for spatial and spatial-temporal data, public health applications, and developing open-source statistical software for health research. I was also responsible for geospatial analysis and cartographic services in UTSW's Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. I have served as a peer-reviewer for various journals of statistics, GIS, and health, including *Statistics in Medicine*, *Spatial Statistics*, *Transactions in GIS*, *IJGIS*, *Scientific Reports*, and *Nature&mdash;Communications Medicine*. I've previously held statistical consulting, data science, and university teaching positions. 

I completed an undergraduate in human geography at University of Minnesota&mdash;Twin Cities and a masters degrees in human geography at University of British Columbia&mdash;Vancouver. There, my attention was focused on the political economy of globalization and neoliberalism, labor, and inequality.
