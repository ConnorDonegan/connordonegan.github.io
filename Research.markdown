<br/> <small><i> Geographical Analysis </i> (2024)
<br/>
This paper provides a review of some important historical developments in spatial-statistical theory, synthesizes and tests some key concepts, and puts the ideas into a critical conversation with recent some writings on the topic. This is the first of two case studies from my dissertation on plausible reasoning. </small>

<a style="color:DarkSlateGray" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/florida/">The Making of Florida's 'Criminal Class': Race, Modernity, and the Convict Leasing Program, 1877-1919</a>
<br/> <small><i> Florida Historical Quarterly </i> (2019)
<br/>
Under the State of Florida’s convict leasing program (1877-1919) approximately 14,000 Floridians and visitors served sentences of hard labor at the pain of the lash. This article, which began as my master’s thesis at UBC, draws on over four decades of reports on the prison system by its administrators in the Florida Department of Agriculture, geographic sentencing data, data on prisoner characteristics, minutes from the Board of Pardons, and additional materials held in the Convict Lease Subject Files in the Florida State Archives, and engages with a number of questions revolving around the inter-connected themes of forced labor, industrial interests, violence, and racial ideology.</small>
