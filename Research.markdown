<a style="color:DarkSlateGray" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/spatial-stats-theory/">Plausible Reasoning and Spatial-Statistical Theory</a>
<br/> <small><i> Geographical Analysis </i> (2024)
<br/>
This paper provides a review of some important historical topics in spatial-statistical theory, synthesizes and tests some key concepts, and puts the ideas into conversation with recent some writings on the topic. This is the first of two case studies from my dissertation on plausible reasoning. </small>


<a style="color:DarkSlateGray" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/surveil-paper/">Modeling time trends for disease surveillance studies</a>
<br/> <small><i> JMIR Public Health &amp; Surveillance </i> (2022)
<br/> Modeling time trends in disease incidence and mortality rates is a routine task for public health research. One method for doing so has become ubiquitous, especially in cancer journals: join-point regression. Join-point has some known drawbacks and, partly for that reason, is not commonly found in general texts on time series modeling. This paper illustrates some of the advantages from applying a more standard time-trend model to disease surveillance research. The models are made available through the 'surveil' software package.

<a style="color:DarkSlateGray" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/florida/">The Making of Florida's 'Criminal Class': Race, Modernity, and the Convict Leasing Program, 1877-1919</a>
<br/> <small><i> Florida Historical Quarterly </i> (2019)
<br/>
Under the State of Florida’s convict leasing program (1877-1919) approximately 14,000 Floridians and visitors served sentences of hard labor at the pain of the lash. This article, which began as a master’s thesis at UBC, draws on over four decades of reports on the prison system by its administrators in the Florida Department of Agriculture, geographic sentencing data, data on prisoner characteristics, minutes from the Board of Pardons, and additional materials held in the Convict Lease Subject Files in the Florida State Archives. The study engages with a number of questions revolving around the inter-connected themes of forced labor, industrial interests, violence, disability, and racial ideology.</small>
