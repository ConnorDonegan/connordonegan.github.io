This post introduces the
[geostan](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan) R package for spatial
analysis. The package is mainly oriented towards areal data, although
some models may also be used for other spatial data types and network data. The package
implements the spatial error/simultaneous spatial autoregressive (SAR)
model, spatial lag model, conditional autoregressive (CAR) model, and eigenvector spatial
filter (ESF) models for spatial regression. (A version of ESF modelling
also appears in the ecology literature as principle coordinate analysis
of neighbor matrices (PCNM); Griffith and Peres-Neto 2006).

`geostan` also supports the application of the above regression methods
to hierarchical models for count data, as is common in analyses of
disease incidence or mortality in small areas (‘disease mapping’).
Additional features of the software include models for
sampling/measurement error in covariates and methods for handling
censored count data, such as when mortality or disease counts have been
censored for privacy. The models were built using the
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) modeling language, so all inference is
completed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (Stan
Development Team 2023; Gabry et al. 2024). The spatial autoregressive
models use custom-built Stan functions that speed up MCMC sampling
considerably (Donegan 2021).

This post will walk through an example analysis using international data
on life expectancy and per capita GDP. Package vignettes can be found
with the online
[documentation](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles),
including an introduction to spatial weights matrices, exploratory
spatial data analysis, spatial measurement error models, raster
regression, and using geostan to build custom spatial models with Stan.
A paper in the [*Journal of Open Source
Software*](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04716) reports these and other
features and provides the recommended citation when using `geostan`
(Donegan 2022).

<h2> Installation </h2>

Using your R console, you can install from CRAN as follows:

{% highlight r %}
install.packages("geostan")
{% endhighlight %}

That is the recommended way to install the package.

You can also install from the package github repository:

{% highlight r %}
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')	
devtools::install_github("connordonegan/geostan")
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using Windows and installing using `install_github`, you may
need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
first. Rtools is not needed when installing from CRAN. You may also
contact the author by e-mail for a pre-compiled version that you can use
without Rtools.

If you are using Mac and installing with `install_github` then you may
need to install Xcode Command Line Tools first.


<h2> Getting started </h2>

To begin, load the 'geostan' and 'sf' packages into your R environment,
as well as the 'world' data:

{% highlight r%}
library(geostan)
library(sf)
data(world, package = "spData")
{% endhighlight %}

The 'world' data contains life expectancy and gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita (presumably measured in current $US) for 161 countries
as of 2014, gathered from the World Bank. The rest of this post is going
to be structured around a bivariate analysis of these variables.

We will us this `map_pars` function to help with mapping; it breaks the variables into quantiles and returns the break points, colors, labels for mapping:

{% highlight r %}
map_pars <- function(x, 
 brks = quantile(x, probs = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2), na.rm = TRUE), 
 cols = c("#A8554EFF", "gray95", "#5D74A5FF")) {

  # put x values into bins
  x_cut <- cut(x, breaks = brks, include.lowest = TRUE)
  
  # labels for each bin
  lbls <- levels( cut(x, brks, include.lowest = TRUE) )
  
  # colors 
  rank <- as.numeric( x_cut )  
  max_rank <- max( rank , na.rm = TRUE )
  pal_fun <- colorRampPalette( cols )
  pal <- pal_fun( max_rank )
  colors <-  pal[ rank ]

  # return list
  ls <- list(brks = brks, lbls = lbls, pal = pal, col = colors)
  return( ls )
}
{% endhighlight %}

We are going to apply the Robinson map projection for the countries:

{% highlight r %}
world <- st_transform(world, crs = 'ESRI:54030')
{% endhighlight %}

At least a couple of the missing values can be filled in using World
Bank data, so we will do that:

{% highlight r %}
## https://data.worldbank.org
france <- grep("France", world$name_long)
world$gdpPercap[ france ] <- 43068
world$lifeExp[ france ] <- 82

norway <- grep("Norway", world$name_long)
world$gdpPercap[ norway ] <- 97666
world$lifeExp[ norway ] <- 82.1
{% endhighlight %}

And we will also remove Antarctica:

{% highlight r %}
world <- subset(world, name_long != "Antarctica")
{% endhighlight %}

Mapping the variables shows the familiar geography of high-, middle-,
and low-income countries and a similar geography of longevity:

{% highlight r %}
# store geometry for countries
world_geom <- st_geometry(world)

# show two maps at once, with nice font
ogpar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1),
                 mar = rep(0, 4))

# GDP per capita
pars <- map_pars(world$gdpPercap / 1e3)
plot(world_geom,
 col = pars$col,
 lwd = .2)
legend("bottomleft",
   fill = pars$pal,
   title = 'GDP per capita\n($1,000s)',
   legend = pars$lbls,
   bty = 'n'
)
rm(pars)

# life expectancy
pars <- map_pars(world$lifeExp)
plot(world_geom,
  col = pars$col,
  lwd = .2)
legend("left",
 fill = pars$pal,
 title = 'Life Expectancy',
 legend = pars$lbls,
 bty = 'n'
 )
 
par(ogpar)
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="/assets/2024/spatial-analysis-with-geostan/fig-1.png">
<p class="caption">
<em>Choropleth maps of GDP per capita and life expectancy.</em>
</p>

There will be no discussion of substantive (non-statistical)
issues here, for which one can consult any number of texts on global
power and inequality (such as Birn, Pillay, and Holz’s <em>Textbook of International Health</em>, or John Perkins's <em>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</em>).

By conventional methods, the correlation coefficient for life expectancy
and log GDP per capita is 0.81:

{% highlight r %}
log_x <- log10(world$gdpPercap)
y <- world$lifeExp
cor.test(log_x, y)
{% endhighlight %}

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  log_x and y
    ## t = 17.394, df = 160, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.7478143 0.8561778
    ## sample estimates:
    ##   cor 
    ## 0.8087528


The conventional assessment is based on the proposition that we have 161
independent observations. The visible geography of the variables, and
any level of social awareness, indicates that these are not independent
observations. Rather, there are various functional regions of countries
that share basic political-economic conditions. A lot, but not all, of
the variation can be described as variation across continents and
regions. We will want to account for this dependence using a spatial
model (for background see Chun and Griffith 2012; Donegan 2024). The
first step will be to construct a spatial weights matrix.

<h2> Adjacency matrix </h2>

This section will illustrate use of two `geostan` functions for creating
an revising a spatial weights matrix: `shape2mat` and `edges`. The
`shape2mat` function may be helpful for some users but one can always do
this using `spdep` or other methods, especially if `shape2mat` does not
provide the exact method you’re looking for.

We are going to start by removing the 15 countries that are missing
values:

{% highlight r %}
## remove missing values
world <- subset(world, !is.na(gdpPercap) & !is.na(lifeExp))

## leaving 162 observations
nrow(world)
{% endhighlight %}

    ## [1] 162


Now we can apply the `shape2mat` function to obtain an [adjacency
matrix](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/spatial-weights-matrix.html)
that encodes spatial adjacency relations for countries into a binary
N-by-N matrix. The function uses `spdep` to find adjacency relations and
returns results as a sparse matrix (using the `Matrix` package):

{% highlight r %}
A <- shape2mat(world, "B", method = "rook")
{% endhighlight %}

    ## Contiguity condition: rook

    ## Number of neighbors per unit, summary:

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##   0.000   2.000   3.000   3.605   5.000  13.000

    ## 
    ## Spatial weights, summary:

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##       1       1       1       1       1       1

Visualizing the connections in the matrix is important for uncovering
unexpected results. `geostan`’s `edges` function converts the matrix
into a list of nodes and edges that we can plot. For this we need to
supply the function with the adjacency matrix, `A`, and the associated
spatial object, `world`:

{% highlight r %}
# edges with geometry
E <- edges(A, shape = world) 
graph <- st_geometry(E)

ogpar <- par(mar = rep(0, 4))
# plot countries
plot(world_geom, lwd = .1)
# add graph nodes
plot(graph, add = TRUE, type = 'p')
# add graph edges
plot(graph, add = TRUE, type = 'l')
{% endhighlight %}    

<img src="/assets/2024/spatial-analysis-with-geostan/fig-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    par(ogpar)

This reveals quite a few unexpected results. French Guiana is stored in
the `world` data as part of France (a multi-part polygon); this is
correct of course but it leads to Brazil and Suriname being listed as
neighbors of France, which is not sensible. Besides removing those
connections, there are a number of island nations that we might want to
connect to nearby places.

To connect Mozambique to Madagascar, we just replace the zeroes with
ones in the slots that correspond to those countries. First we grab
their index positions in the matrix:

{% highlight r %}
moz_idx <- grep("Mozambique", world$name_long)
mad_idx <- grep("Madagascar", world$name_long)
{% endhighlight %}

And then we assign the correct slots in the matrix a value of 1 (or
`TRUE`), remembering that the adjacency matrix is symmetric:

{% highlight r %}
A[moz_idx, mad_idx] <- A[mad_idx, moz_idx] <- TRUE
{% endhighlight %}

This can become tedious but it is important. Before moving on, we will
make a series of adjustments. This will be made a bit easier with this
convenience function:

{% highlight r %}
connect <- function(country_a, country_b,
names_vec = world$name_long, matrix = A, add = TRUE) {
  stopifnot( country_a %in% names_vec )
  stopifnot( country_b %in% names_vec )
  a_idx <- which(names_vec == country_a)
  b_idx <- which( names_vec == country_b)
  matrix[a_idx, b_idx] <- matrix[b_idx, a_idx] <- add
  return( matrix )
}
{% endhighlight %}

The following are at least reasonable changes to make; they also ensure
that every country has at least one neighbor:

{% highlight r %}
A <- connect("Mozambique", "Madagascar")
A <- connect("Australia", "New Zealand")
A <- connect("Philippines", "Malaysia")
A <- connect("Japan", "Republic of Korea")
A <- connect("Fiji", "Vanuatu")
A <- connect("Solomon Islands", "Vanuatu")
A <- connect("Solomon Islands", "Papua New Guinea")
A <- connect("Australia", "Papua New Guinea")
A <- connect("Haiti", "Jamaica")
A <- connect("Bahamas", "United States")
A <- connect("Dominican Republic", "Puerto Rico")
A <- connect("Trinidad and Tobago", "Venezuela")
A <- connect("Sri Lanka", "India")
A <- connect("Cyprus", "Turkey")
A <- connect("Cyprus", "Lebanon")
A <- connect("Norway", "Iceland")

## remove connections between South American and France
A <- connect("Suriname", "France", add = FALSE)
A <- connect("Brazil", "France", add = FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

We should look at the revised adjacency matrix:

    graph <- st_geometry( edges(A, shape = world) )
    ogpar <- par(mar = rep(0, 4))
    plot(world_geom, lwd = .1)
    plot(graph, add = TRUE, type = 'p')
    plot(graph, add = TRUE, type = 'l')

<img src="/assets/2024/spatial-analysis-with-geostan/fig-3.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    par(ogpar)

Sometimes it can help to examine the edge list interactively using a
proper geographic information system like QGIS. For those who are
familiar with (non-R) GIS software, you can save the edges list as a
GeoPackage and then open it up in your GIS to examine the connections
‘by hand’ with a base map or other data:

{% highlight r %}
E <- edges(A, shape = world)
st_write(E, "world.gpkg", layer = "edge list")
{% endhighlight %}

<h2> Non-spatial regression </h2>

Fitting regression models with `geostan` is similar to using base R’s
`glm` function: the user provides a model formula, data, and the model
family or distribution. We can fit a normal linear model using the
`stan_glm` function:

{% highlight r %}
fit_lm <- stan_glm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = world, quiet = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

And we can examine parameter estimates by printing to the console:

    print(fit_lm)

    ## Spatial Model Results

    ## Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Thu Aug  1 12:33:33 2024.
    ## For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
    ## and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
    ## convergence, Rhat=1).

The output printed to the console provides a summary of the posterior
probability distributions of the model parameters. The distributions can
also be visualized using `plot(fit_lm)`:

{% highlight r %}
plot(fit_lm)
{% endhighlight %}

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

<img src="/assets/2024/spatial-analysis-with-geostan/fig-4.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The mean of the distribution is reported in the `mean` column. For those
who are more familiar with concepts from sampling theory, the `mean` may
be understood as the estimate of the parameter. Each distribution’s
standard deviation is found in the `sd` column; this describes the width
of the posterior distribution. The `sd` is analogous to the standard
error of the estimate. The quantiles also summarize the width of the
posterior distributions; the 2.5% and 97.5% values form a 95% credible
interval for the parameter value.

### MCMC output

The effective sample size (ESS), `n_eff`, tells us how many independent
MCMC samples the inference is based on after adjusting for serial
autocorrelation in the MCMC samples. This is an important quantity to
pay attention to and generally one might like to see these numbers above
400 (or around 100 samples per MCMC chain). The standard error of the
mean, `se_mean`, reports how much MCMC sampling error to expect in the
`mean` (`se_mean` is calculated using `n_eff`). The R-hat statistic,
`Rhat`, should always be very close to 1, preferably less than 1.01. The
R-hat diagnostic tests that the MCMC chains are all depicting the same
distribution. If they diverge from one another, it either means that you
need to draw a higher number of MCMC samples (run the chains for longer)
or that there is a problem fitting the model to your data.

By default, `geostan` models run four independent MCMC chains for 3,000
iterations each, half of which is discarded as warm-up. The number of
iterations is controlled by the `iter` argument, the default being
`iter = 3e3`. For some models this may be too low and you will want to
increase this. Other times this might be *more* than is needed in which
case you can reduce the computation time by using fewer iterations. What
matters most is not your number of iterations but your ESS and R-hat
statistics. When it comes to reporting results, it is generally best to
use at least the default of four MCMC chains (`chains = 4`).

### Methods

A number of familiar methods are available for working with `geostan`
models including `fitted`, `resid`, and `predict`.

The `fitted` method returns a `data.frame` with summaries of the fitted
values. The probability distribution for each fitted value is summarized
by its posterior mean, standard deviation, and quantiles:

{% highlight r %}
fdf <- fitted(fit_lm)
head(fdf)
{% endhighlight %}

    ##               mean        sd     2.5%      20%      50%      80%    97.5%
    ## fitted[1] 70.22990 0.3969583 69.46571 69.88939 70.23141 70.55628 71.00631
    ## fitted[2] 63.46359 0.5884022 62.31542 62.98235 63.45552 63.94977 64.64037
    ## fitted[3] 79.33702 0.6206999 78.07451 78.81257 79.34308 79.86151 80.53088
    ## fitted[4] 80.36367 0.6675295 79.01816 79.79764 80.37163 80.93076 81.65248
    ## fitted[5] 76.02492 0.4883834 75.05750 75.61649 76.03594 76.44239 76.95946
    ## fitted[6] 67.88820 0.4339864 67.04641 67.52555 67.88695 68.24651 68.74736

The `resid` method behaves similarly. Examining the Moran scatter plot
using the residuals shows a moderate degree of positive SA as well as
some skewness:

{% highlight r %}
rdf <- resid(fit_lm)
moran_plot(rdf$mean, A)
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="/assets/2024/spatial-analysis-with-geostan/fig-5.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<h2> Spatial regression </h2>

Options for spatial regression models currently include conditional
autoregressive (CAR), simultaneous autoregressive (SAR/spatial error),
and eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF). For count data, common
variations on the intrinsic autoregressive (ICAR) model are also
available.

All of the spatial models require at least a spatial weights matrix as
input. All additional requirements for data preparation are handled by
`geostan`’s `prep_` functions: `prep_car_data`, `prep_icar_data`,
`prep_sar_data`.

The `make_EV` function is used to create Moran’s eigenvectors for ESF
regression; if you want to create your own eigenvectors (say, following
the PCNM method) you can provide those directly to the ESF model (see
`?stan_esf`).

For the CAR model, we always provide the binary adjacency matrix as
input to `prep_car_data`. See the `prep_car_data` documentation for
options. Here we will fit an intercept-only CAR model to the life
expectancy data:

{% highlight r %}
cars <- prep_car_data(A)
fit_car <- stan_car(lifeExp ~ 1, data = world, car_parts = cars, iter = 1e3, quiet = TRUE)

print(fit_car)
{% endhighlight %}

    ## Spatial Model Results

    ## car_scale  7.827   0.011 0.449  7.000  7.441  7.806  8.202  8.761  1564 1.001
    ## 
    ## Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Thu Aug  1 12:33:38 2024.
    ## For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
    ## and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
    ## convergence, Rhat=1).

Notice that using `iter = 1000` was more than adequate for inference in
this case.

The CAR model has a spatial dependence parameter `car_rho`. This
parameter does *not* have an interpretation similar to a correlation
coefficient, and it is often near 1; this is not a problem unless one
misinterprets it or desires a value similar to the correlation
coefficient. The spatial dependence parameter in the SAR model has a more 'intuitive' interpretation.

### A filtering approach

Returning to the correlation coefficient estimated above, one way to
adjust our estimate for spatial dependence is to filter out the spatial
trend from each of the two variables and then calculate the correlation
coefficient using the detrended values (Chun and Griffith 2012, 71).
This spatial ‘filtering’ or ‘pre-whitening’ method is not particularly
common in practice these days, but its a good trick to know given the familiarity of
the correlation coefficient. We will use it here to demonstrate some
basic features of the software.

The spatial trend term can be extracted from any spatial `geostan` model
using the `spatial` method.

{% highlight r %}
theta <- spatial(fit_car)$mean

pars <- map_pars(theta)
ogpar <- par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(st_geometry(world),
  col = pars$col,
  lwd = .2)
legend("left",
 fill = pars$pal,
 title = 'Spatial trend (LE)',
 legend = pars$lbls,
 bty = 'n'
 )
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="/assets/2024/spatial-analysis-with-geostan/fig-6.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    par(ogpar)

We can obtain detrended values most simply by taking the residuals from
an intercept-only spatial model:

{% highlight r %}
# lifeExpt detrended
dy <- resid(fit_car)$mean

# log per capita GDP detrended
fit_carx <- stan_car(log(gdpPercap) ~ 1, data = world, car = cars, iter = 1e3, quiet = TRUE)
dx <- resid(fit_carx)$mean
{% endhighlight %}

Using `cor.test` with those provides an estimate of correlation adjusted
for spatial autocorrelation:

{% highlight r %}
# adjusted correlation
cor.test(dx, dy)
{% endhighlight %}    

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  dx and dy
    ## t = 9.1418, df = 160, p-value = 2.666e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.4744113 0.6786559
    ## sample estimates:
    ##       cor 
    ## 0.5857574

The adjusted estimate of .59 is considerably different from the naive
estimate of .80 and is outside the naive confidence intervals. (The
adjusted estimate is .62, basically the same, if we use SAR models.)

### A bivariate model

Here we will use the SAR model to illustrate its use. Fitting the
spatial error or SAR model requires nearly the same steps as above.

Unlike `prep_car_data`, be sure to row-standardize the adjacency matrix
before passing it to `prep_sar_data`.

{% highlight r %}
W <- row_standardize(A)

When fitting the model, we are going to add `centerx = TRUE` to center
the covariate. (Internally this will call
`center(x, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)`.) This will not change
coefficient estimates but it does often improve MCMC sampling
efficiency, sometimes considerably so. It does change interpretation of
the intercept: the intercept will be an estimate of the average life
expectancy (or the expected life expectancy when all covariates are at
their average values).

{% highlight r %}
fit_sar <- stan_sar(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap),
                    data = world,
	            sar_parts = sars,
		    centerx = TRUE,
                    iter = 1e3,
		    quiet = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

Lets plot the results this time:

{% highlight r %}
plot(fit_sar)
{% endhighlight %}

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

The spatial dependence parameter is around 0.7, which indicates
moderately strong SA. The mean life expectancy is about 71 (probably
somewhere between about 69 and 74). And the coefficient for log GDP is
around 4 (or somewhere between 3 and 5). The residual variation has a
standard deviation of around 3.6 years.

If we scale both variables before fitting the bivariate spatial
regression model (so that their variances both equal 1) then we get
approximately the same estimate as the adjusted correlation coefficient
(above). The credible interval is slightly wider because uncertainty in
rho is (appropriately) incorporated here:

{% highlight r %}
world <- transform(world,
  sx = scale(log(gdpPercap), scale = T, center = T),
  sy = scale(lifeExp, scale = T, center = T)
   )

fit_scaled <- stan_sar(sy ~ sx,
                       data = world,
		       sar_parts = sars,
		       iter = 1e3,
		       quiet = TRUE)
print(fit_scaled)
{% endhighlight %}

<h2> Predicted values </h2>

We can visualize the model results by plotting the expected life
expectancy across the full range of GDP per capita. We use the `predict`
function for this. As input, it requires our fitted model and a
`data.frame` with covariate values.

We will start by creating a `data.frame` with GDP per capita values that
span from the minimum to maximum values in the `world` data:

{% highlight r %}
gdp <- range(world$gdpPercap)
min_gdp <- gdp[1]
max_gdp <- gdp[2]
pdf <- data.frame(gdpPercap = seq(min_gdp, max_gdp, length.out = 200))
{% endhighlight %}

The column names in this `data.frame` have to match the variable names
that were present in the data that we first provided to the model. In
this case, the name of the columns should match those from the `world`
data. Likewise, we provide the new GDP data on its original
(un-transformed) scale, just as we did when we fit the model using
`stan_sar` (the log transformation will be applied by `predict` because
it is specified in the model formula). Because we centered the covariate
using the `centerx = TRUE` argument, we will also allow the `predict`
function to handle the centering automatically using information that is
stored with the fitted model (`stan_sar$x_center`).

Now we pass this new data to `predict`:

{% highlight r %}
preds <- predict(fit_sar, newdata = pdf)
{% endhighlight %}

The output includes our `pdf` data plus some new columns. The new
columns provide a summary of the predicted values. As usual, the `mean`
is the estimate and the estimate is accompanied by other values that can
be used to taken as credible intervals for the predicted value. The
output reflects uncertainty in the model parameter estimates.

{% highlight r %}
head(preds)
{% endhighlight %}

These ‘predicted’ values represent the expectation of the outcome
variable at the given level of the covariates. So we would expect actual
observations to form a cloud of points around the ‘predicted’ values. To
calculate these predicted values, the `predict` function only includes
covariates and the intercept, it does not include any spatial
autocorrelation components. Its purpose is to examine implications of
the coefficient estimates on recognizable scales of variation, not to
predict values for particular places. (The log-linear model can also be
interpreted in terms of percent changes in the covariate, such as ’a 10%
increase in GDP per capita, e.g., from 10,000 to 11,000, is associated
with around 4 \* log(11/10) = 0.38 additional years of life expectancy
on average.)
