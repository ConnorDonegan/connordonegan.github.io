Social and health researchers are increasingly interested in the ways that macro-societal structures can shape population distributions of health and well-being. Among health researchers, this interest in causality and social structures has led to debates over the ability of the current ‘causal inference’ paradigm (which draws from the clinical trial setting) to provide a fruitful methodology for answering such questions. This dissertation is motivated by the need for new frameworks that can promote rigorous and insightful research on social structures and health. To that end, this dissertation brings realist theories of social science into conversation with plausible reasoning (PR) or ‘probability as logic’, an epistemology that developed mainly within physics and mathematics. 

The main case study of the dissertation examines the evolution of the colorectal cancer (CRC) burden in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan regions, where a preliminary study documented a persistent and substantial black-white CRC inequality. Drawing from the influential 'neighborhood effects' paradigm in urban sociology, a growing literature in social epidemiology now argues that residential segregation is a, if not the, driving cause of such cancer disparities. This case study employs principles of PR to formulate a series of research questions that stress-test this segregation hypothesis with respect to CRC in urban Texas. The dynamic urbanization processes unfolding in Texas provide opportunities for testing ‘place-bound’ explanations of social and health inequality.

The study shows that as of 1999-2004, nearly the entirety of the black-white disparity in CRC incidence (c. 300 excess CRC cases) could be accounted for by a small number of historically segregated areas in Dallas and Houston. As uptake of screening colonoscopy increased on average, severe economic inequality in CRC risk emerged across both regions. Similarly, the racial CRC disparity outside of historically segregated neighborhoods grew from being marginal to constituting about half of the total disparity in both urban regions. The spatial disease dynamics uncovered in this study are difficult to explain as a result of segregation but are more readily understood as emerging from the constraints of widespread economic precarity. A practical implication of these findings is that place-based cancer screening interventions could be valuable but would not match the scale and spatial extent of the problem. 

Methodologically, the dissertation synthesizes key concepts and heuristics from PR that can support research on social structures. The principles leverage the comparative nature of scientific inference, and they promote study designs that seek incremental progress by examining points of conflict between (classes of) competing theories that share specific empirical grounds or consequences.
