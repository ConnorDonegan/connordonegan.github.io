title: Plausible reasoning and social science methodology
permalink: /dissertation/
---

This dissertation builds upon George Pólya’s writings on plausible reasoning (PR) to contribute to research methodology in human geography. Legal arguments, scientific inference, medical diagnoses, and 'common sense' reasoning all rely upon judgments of credibility which cannot hope to reach the status of deductive proof. PR is part of a tradition in epistemology that aims to develop an 'extended logic' that account for this type of reasoning, and within which deductive logic would appear as a special case. Pólya is a unique and important author in this tradition because he not only developed powerful principles of plausible inference but also showed how they can be employed heuristically to propel forward an investigation.

Pólya’s writings on problem solving and the connections between intuitive and rigorous scientific reasoning have not been taken up directly in the social sciences, although they did inspire the influential philosopher Imre Lakatos as well as the physicist/probability-theorist E. T. Jaynes. The dissertation extends Pólya’s methods to the social and health sciences and shows how principles of plausible inference can be employed heuristically to help formulate research questions and conjectures, debate the weight of evidence, and clarify analogies. The dissertation develops these ideas through a pair of case studies: the first employs analogical reasoning and Monte Carlo methods to engage with a debate over spatial-statistical theory, and the second draws from critical urban studies and critical realism to study the evolution of the colorectal cancer (CRC) burden in urban Texas following advancements in CRC prevention technology.
