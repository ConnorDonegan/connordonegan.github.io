title: Plausible reasoning and critical realism
permalink: /dissertation/
---

This dissertation builds upon George Pólya’s heuristic method of inductive and analogical reasoning to contribute to research methodology in human geography. Plausible reasoning is presented here as a practical methodology that aims to specify the logical relations behind judgments of credibility and to leverage them in heuristic and dialectic fashion to aid in the processes of formulating questions and conjectures, debating the weight of evidence, and clarifying analogies. After Harold Jeffreys, I view plausible reasoning as an epistemological complement to ‘critical realist’ philosophies of science. The dissertation develops these ideas through a pair of case studies: the first employs analogical reasoning to engage with debates over spatial-statistical theory, and the second draws from critical urban studies and epidemiology to study the socio-spatial evolution of the colorectal cancer (CRC) burden in urban Texas following advancements in CRC prevention technology.
